This is a daemon, or a "service", if you prefer calling it that. Once started, it should run forever.
It should check Magnificent frequently - at least several times a minute.
The service has to indicate how healthy the Magnificent service has been, over the last little while.
The service should also tell our system administrator if Magnificent has not been responding at all.
This should go without saying, but you can't use anyone else's code, unless it's under an open-source license. If you need to copy a snippet from Stack Overflow or some similar site, that's okay. But you should be the primary author of, and understand, all the code you submit.
Please refrain from including any identifying information in your submission, such as comments with your name, author information in a setup file, etc.
